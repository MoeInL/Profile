# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I‚Äôm Moe! I‚Äôm dedicated to building exceptional web and mobile experiences, specializing in React Native using TypeScript. Currently, I‚Äôm mastering Next.js and Express.js to solidify my full-stack skills aiming to explore Three.js to create stunning 3D visuals and interactive applications.  

I focus on creating intuitive and visually engaging applications. My expertise includes crafting smooth animations, designing custom UI components, and optimizing app performance to deliver seamless user experiences. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, such as implementing deep linking for navigation, integrating gesture-based interactions, and designing dynamic, responsive layouts that adapt to different devices and use cases. My goal is to combine creativity and technical precision to build apps that are both functional and delightful to use.

I‚Äôm a problem solver who values continuous learning, turning every project into an opportunity for growth. I‚Äôm eager to collaborate with other developers, share knowledge, and create innovative solutions. Let‚Äôs connect and build the future of web and mobile development together!
